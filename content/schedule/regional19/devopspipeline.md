Business Applications nowadays are rarely composed of just one component, residing on just one platform.  
Some parts may be on z, some on Linux and some on for instance a mobile device.  
But still, from a business perspective they are one application.  
This means it is useful, or even necessary to regard the DevOps pipeline for that business application as one pipeline too.  
Or at least as two pipelines that are connected, and with the developers speaking the same "language" when it comes to practices and tooling.  
In contrary to what many people believe, this is very well possible.  
Z and Distributed donâ€™t need to be separate worlds. In this presentation I will show how.
