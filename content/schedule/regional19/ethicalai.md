As enterprises build and deploy artificial intelligence systems, it's important to understand the ethical considerations of our work.  
Ethics are not a separate business objective bolted on after an AI system has been deployed.  
They are part of business performance.  
Only by embedding ethical principles into AI applications and processes can we build systems that people can trust.  
In this session we will explore the 'dangers of AI' being bias, (lack of) explanation and robustness issues.  
Next to that we will explore the AI Fairness 360 toolkit and IBM's Trust & Transparency service.
