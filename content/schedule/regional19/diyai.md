Today, perhaps surprisingly, AI is becoming accessible, concrete and maintainable.  
Yet, as many cases are 'black boxes' developed by data scientists, it doesn't always seem that way.  
IBM has partnered up with Robovision to help democratize AI,
through concrete applications that demonstrate value with a very high speed-to-insight.  
Join our session to learn how to spot, size and successfully deliver AI cases without the need for an MIT degree.
