At its essence, DevOps is a culture, a movement, a philosophy.  
It's a firm handshake between development and operations that emphasizes a shift in mindset,
better collaboration, and tighter integration.  
DevOps targets your product delivery throughout the entire service lifecycle, from design to production support.  

With new and emerging solutions and platforms such as public cloud DevOps reduces the latency
that has existed for decades around software development, are you ready to take the leap?
