Agility is a way to work.  
Agility is a way of thinking.   
Agility is to stay open to the current changes and to stay open for the future. 
We will demonstrate how we can help you during your journey of agility and
how to demystify this one giant leap for mankind (because system z leads mankind).  
We will start at the root base with the open source enterprise class operating system and
we will finish by the most agile storage ever made. 
At the end of these 45 minutes will get the key to create a full castle with the agility to respond quickly without pain to your internal needs.
