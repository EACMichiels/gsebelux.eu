The session discusses why we are convinced that in most situations companies end up with an infrastructure
which is using diverse cloud solutions combined with some on premise infrastructure.  
With the exception of some born on the cloud companies most organizations have a long past to carry further and
will need to find ways to capitalize on those past investments.  

This brings us to the topic of application modernization.  
In today's world the ideal propose architecture consists of cloud native, micro services based applications.  
How can we find an approach to start in this new world while still reusing some of the systems that have proven their value for the day to day business.
