The pace of technological evolution in computing has been astonishing, allowing for amazing innovation for business and society.  
However, the complexity and size of the challenges that people want to solve with information and communication technology,
make that conventional computers are reaching their limits.  
The reality of both physics and economics threaten the progression of Moore's Law.  
Scientists and engineers have been exploring alternatives to classical computers.  
One of these stands above the others in terms of its speed, power and potential: Quantum Computers.  

Quantum Computers will tackle what is impossible today and will provide extraordinary business advantages in several industries.  
IBM Q System One is a breakthrough solution, and a pioneer for commercially available universal Quantum Computers for business and science.  

In this session, Quantum Computing will be addressed from different angles :  
its necessity and differentation with "classical computers", the application of the Quantum phenomena,
first and future use cases, the new ecosystems, the development of Quantum algorithms and,
last but not least, how to acquire experience and developing your first Quantum Apps using Qiskit Terra and Qiskit Aqua.  

This session takes you to "the next step" with Quantum Computing :  
thru demonstrations you will be motivated to jump into practical hands-on enablement and
training materials and set your first steps in the new Quantum Computing era !
