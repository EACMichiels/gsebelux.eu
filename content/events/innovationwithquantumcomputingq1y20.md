We are living in the mid of the Digital Revolution.  
Almost every second, we apply or experience 'classical' computing in one or the other way.  
However, there are challenges that today's systems will never be able to solve, or at least not in a timely fashion.  
For problems above a certain size and complexity, we just don't have enough computational power to tackle them.  

For solving some of these problems, a new kind of computing can rescue us.  
Quantum Computing leverages the quantum mechanical phenomena of superposition and entanglement to create states that scale exponentially with number of Qubits, or Quantum Bits.  

While early adopters are already defining the first use cases, quite some challenges need to be tackled before we get to the commercial applications of Quantum Computing.  
For example, what about the skills needed to translate a business problem into a Quantum Algorithm? How to increase the number of usable Qubits at acceptable error rate? When is it appropriate to use a Quantum Algorithm to solve an optimization problem?  

For our meeting of 15 January 2020, we have invited leaders in the area of Quantum Computing.  
They will provide you with critical insights about the current and future capabilities of Quantum Computing.  

But more, your inspiration will be triggered to start thinking about the benefits and challenges that come with Quantum Computing and you will be armed to define your Quantum Strategy for the short and midterm. And …who said that the “most interesting questions are those without an absolute answer?  

Do not miss this unique opportunity and enroll for our event on 15 January 2020 !!!  

We are glad we have really top speakers for our event !  

A full schedule is available on our [schedule page](/schedule/innovationwithquantumcomputingq1y20/).
